# 07-nodejs-npm-express

**Author**: Jose && Peter
**Version**: 1.0.2

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
Have a basic understanding of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Must use a text editor and it is highly recommended you use a source code management system such as GitHub. Identify the problem Domain. Create structure and functionality. Will need to use JQuery, AJAX, and understanding how JSON files work. Using nodejs and live server to act as a front end and back end portion to what a user will see and what will be delivered by the server.

## Architecture
We are utilizing nodejs, nodemon express, and live-server.

## Change Log

02-21-2018 12:01pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the new.html file and form submission.

## Credits and Collaborations
Kat assisted us with correcting our nodemon and live-server set up.
