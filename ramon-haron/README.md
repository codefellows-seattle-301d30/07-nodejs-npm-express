# Kilovolt Blog - Lab 06
#Author: Haron and Ramon 

# Version: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

# Overview
This product is designed to give users a consistent reading and navigation experience across mobile and desktop devices, with content ordered by most recent first and sortable by both author or category.

# Getting Started
The user would need to

Create index.html
Get the icons from IcoMoon
Get the normalize.css from github.com/necolas/normalize.css
Search and find images of bacon, baseball, and cats
Add filler text
Build CSS files according to SMACSS methodology
Include link to jQuery library (CDN)
Create the articles as objects within an array with consistent property values
Create a constructor function to make the article array accessible to the constructor's method
Create forEach loops to generate new object instances and then append them to the DOM
Create an array of objects from JSON data to hold the content generation for the DOM for each object.
Create a JS file to generate a more interactive view of the DOM (selecting authors, catagories and hiding/showing full articles as well as navigating the long page as if it was a multipage website).
Add Handlebars library and use it to create a tempalte for the HTML articles.
Did npm init to initialize package.json to showcase our dependencies.
Download Node packages. Install Express and nodemon. 

# Architecture
We used IcoMoon icon font for navigation icons. We included the jQuery and Handlebars libraies We used Chrome to analyze and inspect. Project is built on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
