# Kilovolt Blog - Lab 07

**Authors**: Josh West and Carl Olson
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This product is designed to give users a consistent reading and navigation experience across mobile and desktop devices, with content ordered by most recent first and sortable by both author or category.

## Getting Started
* Create index.html 
* Get the icons from IcoMoon 
* Get the normalize.css from github.com/necolas/normalize.css 
* Search and find images of bacon, baseball, and cats 
* Add filler text Build CSS files according to SMACSS methodology 
* Include link to jQuery library (CDN) 
* Create the articles as objects within an array with consistent property values 
* Create a constructor function to make the article array accessible to the constructor's method 
* Create forEach loops to generate new object instances and then append them to the DOM 
* Create an array of objects from JSON data to hold the content generation for the DOM for each object. 
* Create a JS file to generate a more interactive view of the DOM (selecting authors catagories and hiding/showing full articles as well as navigating the long page as if it was a multipage website). 
* Add Handlebars library and use it to create a tempalte for the HTML articles.
* Implement Node and Express to use the server.js file to send responses to the user. 

## Architecture
We used IcoMoon icon font for navigation icons. We included the jQuery and Handlebars libraies. We used Chrome to analyze and inspect. Project is built on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We also used Node and Express.
