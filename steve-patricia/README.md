# Project Name

**Author**: Patricia Raftery, Steve Starwalt
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview

This application is a website to display hundreds of blog entries. Our problem domain is to create a server and display the blog articles from a json file from the server to the client.

## Getting Started

Start by forking and cloning the starter code from GitHub. Familiarize yourself with the code. Init npm, install express, and nodemon is optional. Make the server and client talk to each other. Make the server send the appropriate files upon request.

## Architecture

This application works by using Javascript, Markdown, Css, Html, JSON, jQuery, Handlebars, and AJAX. This application takes the blog articles from hackerIpsum.json, from the server and displays client-side. We added code in server.js to display a 404 error upon an invalid request. We also used express.
